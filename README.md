# README

This was a very good practice exercise, because I was able to see where I need to practice, and where I know exactly what I'm doing.

I saw that the general actions and commands that I needed to do, I was able to do easily. The part I struggled a little with was the specific syntax of the CRUD actions and routes. I hope to get it down pat with some more practice.
